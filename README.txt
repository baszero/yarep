     ==============================


     Prerequisites:
     --------------

     1) JDK 1.4.X or higher
     2) Ant 1.6.X or higher


     Building YAREP:
     ---------------

     Before running the examples, you need to build YAREP 
     and the examples by executing "ant build-examples" in
     in the current directory.


     Running the examples:
     ---------------------

     Run the examples by executing "ant run-examples".


     Configuration of repositories:
     ------------------------------

     The repositories can be specified within yarep.properties (e.g. build/classes/yarep.properties).
     Each repository is specified by a repository ID and a repository configuration file.


     Using YAREP within another application:
     ---------------------------------------

     A JAR file, build/lib/yarep-LCRxxx.jar can be created by
     executing "ant jar". Take a look at the examples how YAREP
