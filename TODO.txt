    TODO
    ====

    - isResource() really working? (isCollection seems to work ...)
    - implement Path.getParent()
    - Replace UID by UUID
    - Implement Maps (Sitetree, Topic Maps, ...)
    - Implement configurable path implementation (see VFS ...)
    - Introduce namespace for repository config
    - Introduce version/DTD/Schema for repository config
    - Implement resolving of UUID
    - Move implementation out of core
    - Implement versionable interfaces
    - Fix VFS implementation: Can only read yet, but not write, because the UUID map needs to be factorized resp. configurable within the repo config
    - Finish VFS example resp. add sample node
    - FileSystem implementation could return path if .yarep-uid does not exist ... (I think rather NOT ...)
    - Improve Exception Handling
